# AI for Teachers – Workshop Outline (v1)

## Goals (max 3)
- Demystify AI: from magic to method (prompt → structure → output).
- Enable teachers to build one reproducible classroom helper.
- Establish a safe, sustainable workflow (timeboxing + ethics basics).

## Format
- 90 minutes (or 2x45). Live demo + guided exercises.

## Agenda
1) Framing (10') – What AI can/can't do in class; examples.
2) Prompt Engineering basics (15') – roles, constraints, schemas.
3) Live demo (15') – Task generator stub → from input to output.
4) Guided exercise (25') – Adapt a prompt template to subject X.
5) Sharing & critique (15') – rubric-based quick review.
6) Wrap-up (10') – resources, next steps, compliance note.

## Live Demo Runbook
- Show repo structure (`/prompts`, `/apps/task-generator`).
- Edit `input.json` → run stub → show `out/tasks.json`.
- Discuss constraints & output schema.

## Exercise (teacher-facing)
- Start from a template; define goal, input schema, constraints.
- Produce one prompt + sample input; peer-check with rubric.

## Rubric (quick)
- Goal clarity (0–2), Structure (0–2), Constraints (0–2), Reproducibility (0–2), Fit for classroom (0–2).

## Risks / Fallbacks
- No local Python? → demo only + take-home instructions.
- Overwhelm risk → stick to one use-case.
- Ethics/data: no student data; synthetic examples only.

## Next
- Provide templates + a 10-min screencast (later).
